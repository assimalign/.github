# Assimalign

Assimalign was created as a company which "assimilates" and "aligns" technology into a cohesive tech stack. The main mission of the company is to give users a one-stop-ship for all developer needs. As developer platforms grow so does the third-party source code. This leads to bloat and mashing of pieces, like trying force a piece from one puzzle into another. So as a solution instead of doing complete rewrite we look at existing libraries and packages across various languages and assimilate them with consistent abstraction. Are goal is not to completely reinvent the wheel, but rather enhance and replace existing wheels that are either old or need major overhauls.

# Projects
Below is a list of core projects currently underdevelopment or being **maintained**

## OGraph
Inspired by [OData (github.com)](https://github.com/OData), Graph Theory, and [ChilliCream's (github.com)](https://github.com/ChilliCream) GraphQL framework, OGraph is an open source protocol built over HTTP intended to provide the ability to query data similarly to GraphQL while maintaining REST. Similar to OData's implementation of EDM (Entity Data Model) OGraph utilizes Graph Data Modeling to expose data structures.

## Cohesion
The Cohesion platform is cohesive set of SDK's and libraries for building an entire architecture. With cloud native solutions in mind the goal is to bring cloud functionality to on-prem. With a code first implementation a user can utilize the available APIs to run an entire environment locally.
